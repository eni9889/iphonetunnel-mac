<b>iPhone Tunnel 2.3 <i>PE</i> (Python Edition) ALPHA release!</b>

<i>Instructions:</i><br />
What you need to do once you run the program is go to "Preferences..." and enable the checkbox next to "Debug mode." (Otherwise it <i>won't</i> work! Check the issues.)<br />
Set the desired ports (> 1024) and any other settings.<br />
Press "Turn Tunnel On" in the menu item.<br />
Select your desired tool from the "Tools" area.<br />

<b>Enjoy!</b>

This is a crude implementation of the usbmuxd python library from Héctor Martín Cantero @ http://marcansoft.com/blog/iphonelinux/usbmuxd/ .<br />
It is (mostly) thanks to him that we can SSH over USB  to our iTouch-devices on a Mac for the newer iTunes and firmware versions, so be nice and say "Thanks"!

This needs some more work to become user-friendly and a **lot** more to be considered elegant.<br />
However, it does work and all the "Tools" seem to work (though I didn't test tethering).

Help is greatly appreciated. Check the issues, check out the source, build it, drop us (me or novi) a note or a patch or two.
